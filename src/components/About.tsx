              <p className="text-lg">
                My career began at the forefront of digital transformation, spearheading the computerization of banking operations from traditional paper-based workflows to sophisticated digital platforms. This foundational experience in change management and process digitization established my expertise in driving organizational transformation while maintaining operational excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting as a Teller and Credit Officer, I developed comprehensive knowledge of financial operations, risk assessment, and customer service excellence. My proven track record in relationship building and operational efficiency earned me a promotion to Relationship Manager, where I successfully orchestrated customer service operations and managed substantial branch loan portfolios, directly impacting revenue generation and customer satisfaction metrics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pivotal moment came during a major core banking system upgrade, where I recognized the strategic importance of technology leadership and transitioned into IT operations. As a Service Desk Analyst, I quickly advanced to Level 2 Support Specialist, providing mission-critical support for core banking systems across six countries‚ÄîKenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Burundi. This role demanded exceptional problem-solving skills, cultural sensitivity, and the ability to maintain 24/7 system availability for diverse international markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                My evolution continued as a Desktop Support Specialist, where I mastered enterprise Microsoft technologies including Exchange Server, Office 365, Mobile Device Management (MDM), and Microsoft Teams. This position strengthened my expertise in user experience optimization and enterprise collaboration platforms, directly enhancing organizational productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The transition to the Close of Business (COB) operations team marked a defining chapter in my career. Managing critical daily operations, executing complex data extraction processes, and optimizing ETL workflows ignited my passion for data analytics and business intelligence. This hands-on experience with data transformation and process automation revealed the immense potential of data-driven decision making in corporate environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                This data-centric revelation became the catalyst for my strategic professional development journey. Upon career transition, I immediately embarked on an intensive upskilling initiative focused on cloud technologies, software engineering, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. This deliberate investment in emerging technologies reflects my commitment to staying ahead of industry trends and delivering cutting-edge solutions.
