                <p>
                  Some journeys begin with a single spark. Mine began behind a teller's counterâ€”serving people, listening to stories, solving real problems. In that space, I discovered something deeper than routine transactions: the power of systems, the value of trust, and the role technology plays in both.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, I moved from counters to commandsâ€”from the front lines of banking to the intricate back end of digital infrastructure. I learned to speak the language of both people and machines, translating business pain points into reliable, secure, and scalable solutions. As I supported systems that served millions, I never lost sight of the individual behind each click, each ticket, each alert.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've spent over 14 years navigating this intersection: seven years immersed in technical operationsâ€”supporting enterprise applications, securing platforms, managing systems across bordersâ€”and another seven years on the customer side, understanding user needs, building relationships, and turning problems into progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along the way, I've made a deliberate investment in growth. I earned cloud certifications. I studied Python, data, cybersecurity, and DevSecOpsâ€”not as trends, but as tools to build stronger, safer, and smarter digital environments. I've seen what happens when systems go down, and I've helped keep them runningâ€”with 99.7% uptime, streamlined processes, and automation that saves hours every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe in quiet impact. In secure systems that just work. In dashboards that tell the truth. In teams that trust IT not just to fix, but to foresee.
                </p>
                <p className="font-semibold text-slate-800">
                  This is the value I bring: a deep understanding of how technology empowers people, protects data, and propels organizations forward. I don't just support systemsâ€”I support the vision behind them.
